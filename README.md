# Sorting Algorithm Evaluation and Visualization

This project evaluates and visualizes the performance of three classic sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort) on different datasets.

## Project Contents

- **Sorting Algorithm Implementation**: Three sorting algorithms are implemented in `SortingEvaluator.java`
- **Performance Evaluation Report**: `Sorting_Algorithm_Evaluation_Report.md` provides detailed analysis of each algorithm's performance characteristics in different scenarios
- **Interactive Visualization Tool**: Intuitively demonstrates the working process of sorting algorithms through a web interface

## Online Demo

Visit [https://zwdommy.github.io/TASKC/](https://zwdommy.github.io/TASKC/) to view the sorting algorithm visualization demo.

## Features

- Supports step-by-step visualization of three sorting algorithms
- Provides multiple preset datasets for demonstration
- Includes detailed performance comparison charts and data
- Modern and minimalist interface design

## Local Execution

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file to run the visualization tool in your browser
3. Run `SortingEvaluator.java` to re-evaluate algorithm performance

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (pure native implementation)
- Data Visualization: Chart.js
- Algorithm Implementation: Java
